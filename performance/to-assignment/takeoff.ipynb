    "# Individual assignment on Takeoff Weight Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a TL (take-off weight limitation) table for a B777-300ER  commercial aircraft for Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok International Airport runway 25C with the environmental condition of 17 degrees Celsius and no wind. The B777-300ER has two certified take-off flap settings of 5 and 15, 15 degrees will be used for the calculations. The aircraft is equipped with GE90-115B engines that deliver a thrust of 104,500 lbs per engine at sea level. The engine is flat rated up to ISA+15ºC. Above ISA+15° the thrust decreases by 0.4% per degree. Explain and make a conclusion of your results!\n",
