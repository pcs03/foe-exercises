# Explorative Data Analysis Workshop 1  (Statistics for DS)


The instructions in this file assume that you are using Spyder by Anaconda. 
They might be different if you are using Jupyler. For example: Jupyler prints
all columns when you use the command df.head(). Spyder just prints some columns, 
it is desirable to use the Variable Explorer instead. 


# Objective:
    1.- Execute a simple EDA.
    2.- Clean DATA
    3.- Plot Distributions and Box Plots
    4.- Proof that there is a relationship between area and house cost.
    5.- Plot a Categorial Data
    6.- Plot a Correlation Matrix

# 0: Import all your required libreries
from scipy import stats

# DATASET PRELIMINAR ANALYSIS
# 1: Load the file "Amsterdam2021.csv" and assign it to df.

df = pd.read_csv("./amsterdam.csv")

# 2: Make a Copy of this dataset to df_original.
# HINT: DataFrame.copy()

df_original = df.copy()

# 3: Explore your dataset. Use the function DataFrame.head() and assign it to data_head.

data_head = df.head()
print(data_head)

# 3A Open this new variable in the data_head and aswer the next questions

# How many Variables do you have in this dataset?

print(data_head.keys())

# How many datapoints do you have in this data set?
# Use df.shape to verify your answers

print(data_head.shape[0])

# How many continous variables do yo have?
# How many discrete varialbes do you have?
# How many categorial variables do you have in that dataset?
# Discuss your answers with your team member.

print("Discrete: Room, Area")
print("Continous: Price, Lon, Lat")
print("Categorial: Address, Zip")


# Use DataFrame.dtypes.astype(str).value_counts() to give you an idea of your answers
# Do you all agree? Ask another team :)
# Cannot agree? look for me and we can discuss this.

print(df.dtypes.astype(str).value_counts())

# 4: Print your column names

print(data_head.keys())

# 5: Rename "Unnamed: 0" as "Index"

df = df.rename(columns={"Unnamed: 0": "Index"})
print(df.head())

# Now, you have an idea of what information your dataset contains.

### EDA ###
# EDA: Varibles exporation
# 6.- Save a description of your numerical variables as variable df_description_numerical.
# HINT: describe()

df_descriptional_numerical = df.describe()


# 6A.- Observe and analyse the variable df_description_numerical.

print(df_descriptional_numerical)


# Why is there a difference in the count of datapoints for the variable price?

# Does the information in the variable "index" is useful for the analysis?
# If so, why?. If it is not there why should we or should we not delete it?
# Can we avoid havig that column at all? If you look at the original csv file,
# that variable does not exist.

# 7.- Save a description of your categorial  variables as variable df_description_categorical.
# HINT: (inclde = object)

df_descriptional_categorical = df.select_dtypes(include="object")
print(df_descriptional_categorical)


# Why are there frequencies of the variable "Address" larger than one? Is this logical?
# Find a frequency of two in your data set and think about it. Example: "Ringdijk, Amsterdam"

print(df_descriptional_categorical["Address"].value_counts())


# EDA: Missing values
# 8.- Determine how many missing values are in the dataframe
# HINT .isnull() and/or .sum() might help you

missing_values = df[df["Price"].isnull()]

# 8A.- Compute the percentage of missing values from the dataset and save it in missing_values_per

missing_values_per = missing_values.shape[0] / df.shape[0]
print(f"{round(missing_values_per * 100, 2)}%")

# 8B.- Identify and analyse the missing values.
# HINT: isnull() and/or .any(axis =1)
#      What would be the best way to handle these missing values?


# Wait. think about it before going further down


# Are you sure you gave it enough thought?


# ANTWOORD(yes... a dutch word, Respuesta or Soluci√≥n sound better, but oh well):
# Remove them for now, they are too different.
# 9.- Remove the values from the data set.
#     HINT: .index and axis = 0 might help.

df = df.drop(index=missing_values.index, axis=0)


# 10.- Verify that you indeed delete the N/A values and review the new data point count.
#  HINT: .shape and .isnull().sum()

print(df.shape)
print(df[df["Price"].isnull()])


# 11.- Show a scatter plot for House Price and Area. Name your labels and add
# a title to your plot.

house_area_price = plt.scatter(x=df["Area"], y=df["Price"])
plt.show()


# Which value is in your Y axis? Why?
# Does it look like a linear relationship to you?
# In simple words, how would you interpretate this plot?

# 12.- Plot an Histogram for the variable Area. bins= 100. Name your axis
#      Feel free to play with bins size. What does it do?
#      I expect you to google how to do this... yes i know... just google it...


# 13.- Plot an Histogram for the variable Price. bins= 100. Name your axis


# What can you conclude from this distribution. Are there outliers?
# There are different rules to define outliers. We will cover this in a different
# workshop

# 14.- Draw a Boxplot for House Area. Name your axisa and add a title name
#      Some concepts define an outlier as any point farther from 1.5 IQR.
#      Under this concept, would you think that there are outliers?

# 15.- Draw a Boxplot for House Price. Name your axis and add a title name
# What is the median for price?


# 16.- Remove the last letters from your ZIP code including the blank space
#      We are coding the ZIP code (witout the letters) to be used as regression
#      I know... i never told you explicitly how to to this. But you can do it!

# 17.- Change the column ['ZIP] to int
# Hint: .astype(int)


# 18.- Plot the scatter plot Zip Code Vs Price


# Did you expect this result?
# I did not... Why are not houses in Zuid WAAAAY more expensive? Or houses in
# the center... (i know, who wants to live in the center?... Tourists and AirBNB
# or those expats, expats learn to move out eventually though :)  )

# 19.- Plot the distribution of Zip Code


# 20.- Plot the distribution of every Zip Code vs Price
# HINT: USE sns.boxplot(x = ____, y = ____)
# Suggestion: _ = plt.xticks(fontsize = 6, rotation=90)
# Would you think there are outliers there?


# 21 - Google the method DataFrame.corr() and implement it


# What are the two values that postitevly correlate more with Price?
# What is the infleunce of the house location (ZIP code) in Price?

# 22.- Plot a heat correlation map
# HINT: sns.heatmap
# HINT2 : You need corrmat


# Can you undestand this heat map?
# Explain this map to your team memembers.
# Tell them wich variables/features you think are more important and why.
# No one knows? Ask that friend from the other team
# Still lost?
# Come see me
