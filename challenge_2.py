Problem
Ask a given integer number to the user. The given number should then be translated
to Morse code. Separate the numbers by two spaces. The program keeps requesting
numbers until the user types "quit" (removing the quotes). The program should 
validate the input. Only Integer numbers, decimal numbers and the word "quit" 
should be valid. 

Some Steps to guide you are shown below. However they are not complete. These
steps are just a proposal, you can do whatever you see fit. 


Morse Code:
0    -----
1    ..---
2    ..---
3    ...--
4    ....-
5    .....
6    -....
7    --...
8    ---..
9    ----.

Objective: 
    1.- Use a while loop
    2.- Use of IF statements

# STEP 0: Set up a while loop

# STEP 1: Ask the user to provide a number (or to type quit) If quit, Exit the 
# progam and notify the user s/he has typed quit. 

# STEP 2: Validate the input. If valid continue, Otherwise, notify the user that
# the input was not valid and ask for a new number. 

# STEP 3: Convert the provided number to Morse Code

# STEP 4: Show the provided number and its Morse Code representation.
